# Chess game in C++ using the SFML graphic library

This is an offline chess game in C++, that incorporates an AI as well as an offline game to play with a friend.

Some things to note:
1. the AI is upgradeable and can be easily modified to match whatever experiment you might have :)
2. this is my first ever project in C++ as well as in coding in general, so the code might be suboptimal and a little buggy
3. ENJOY!

I think that my way of generating moves is pretty intuitive and this was the most challenging part.
